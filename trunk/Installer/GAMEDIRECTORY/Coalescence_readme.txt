The following keys might be useful for testing purposes.  They're not in the controls screen because they're not normal play keys, but we use them for debugging purposes.

T:	Resets player rotation and allows tunnelling through objects if player gets stuck.
L:	Loads next level.
~:	Opens debug console.

The following are debug console commands that you may find useful.

MODE 1:	Turns on debug draw and enables debug property bars.
